## Work Day Scheduler

* The work-day scheduler allows a user to assign a schedule for standard work day hours. 
* Upon opening, the user is presented with the current date and a time block for each hour between 9 AM - 5 PM.
* The page alerts the user if the hour is past, present, or future based on the color. 
* The user is able to select a time block and type in their message before hitting the save button on the right. 
* The time and event message is saved to local storage and pulled back so that should the user need to leave the page or refresh, no information is lost.
* Any information entered can be removed by selecting the text, deleting, and pressing the save button again. 
* The time and date data is pulled in so that the page resets the following day and presents the user with an empty slate to begin again. The current year is attached to the date to ensure no events saved this year pull through to the next.
